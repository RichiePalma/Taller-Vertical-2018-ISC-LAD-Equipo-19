# Cenergy 

## What is our challenge?

The challenge to solve is summed up as the power to create sustainable and clean energy for everyone, only since 2014, only 85.3% of the population, has access to electricity. This way, we propose to change this so that our generation understands the context and creates awareness thanks to our movement.

## What's our game about?

The game mode is based on games of construction of cities, the creation of an utopia in which the
user is ruler of this region, the city employed is fictitious and does not plan to exemplify something
of the real life, however, this seeks to raise awareness of the responsible use for the resources and
how to use them in an efficient way to conserve and create sustainable and long-term energies.
You are the mayor of this utopia in which all decisions, investments and sustainability for a better
quality of life are improved and chosen by you, maintaining the balance and entertainment, while
each player will be able to choose between two options at a time for each case, in turn, each
case will express the current situation of your city, depending on these options the state will
change the region so you will be able to know how good of a mayor you are.

The game will contain four indicators:Sustainability, Happiness of the city, Resources, Pollution

These indicators will show the status, from 0 to 100%, with some balls that will indicate the
level that the user has in each one of the four indicators. in the case of getting 100% in the
pollution indicator, or 0% in any of the other indicators, the player will loose and the game will end.
This way, players can compare their utopias and compete to see who has the best city, trying to keep the city for the longest time.

## Hardware and software

### Unity

The main software used to develop the gameplay of Cenergy was through the use of the Unity Engine. Using C# as the main language for script, the mix of both scripts and assets were succesfully developed in the software previously mentioned.

### Google Cardboard

Using Insignia's Virtual Reality Viewer as the main model of Google Carboard, the team was able to test the development of Cenergy.
